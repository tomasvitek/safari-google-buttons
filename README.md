# Safari Google Buttons

Small Safari extention which adds two buttons to your toolbar, which open Gmail and Google Calendar. If you have the web app already opened, it will just switch to the tab with it, if not it will open a new tab and load the service.

## Why?

I tried using Chrome several times, but (for various reasons) I always came back to Safari. The only thing I was really missing were "pinned" tabs. But I found myself using practicaly only for Gmail and Google Calendar. So I build this tiny extension for Safari to replace the two pinned tabs for me in Safari.

(If you don't like the icons, make better ones and send them to me, I will replace them.)

## Instalation

Just download this file and open it ~ https://github.com/tomikvitek/safari-google-buttons/raw/master/Google%20Buttons.safariextz

## Can you add Google Whatever service?

Yes, I can. But you'll have probably have it faster just forking this repo and doing it yourself (the code is really easy).
